in
this
first
week
,
we
run
a
series
of
talks
which
focus
on
different
aspects
of
the
library
and
its
resources
Clearly
you
can
find
lots
on
there
but
much
of
it
is
useless
information
as
it
is
from
highly
debatable
sources
at
very
little
extra
cost
Clearly
some
of
you
will
find
the
printed
version
more
accessible
as
it
sits
on
the
shelves
but
I
’
m
afraid
the
intention
is
to
phase
these
out
eventually
some
of
you
may
prefer
to
borrow
a
book
rather
than
sit
in
the
library
I
just
oversee
your
induction
the
training
will
also
include
some
time
on
the
computers
different
ways
to
run
data
programmes
ask
them
how
they
would
like
you
to
organise
the
bibliography
When
you
’
ve
got
something
together
the
trainer
here
will
look
through
the
draft
version
for
you
to
see
if
it
’
s
OK

most

contain

felt
that

abruptly

rounding
it
off

Q26

made
very
little

found
myself
wondering

You
used
a

words

the

you
always
explained

Years
ago
,
I
went
to
a
carpet
shop
with
my
parents
when
we
were
on
holiday
in
Turkey
,
and
I
remember
all
the
amazing
colours
(
Q21
)
Then
I
decided
to
include
others
as
well
,
so
I
looked
at
cotton
and
wool
and
nylon
(
Q22
)
Like
I
was
using
one
vegetable
,
beetroot
,
for
a
red
dye
,
and
I
had
to
chop
up
a
whole
pile
of
it
(
Q23
)
but
when
I
rinsed
the
material
,
the
colour
just
washed
away
(
Q24
)
it
’
s
not
permanent
when
it
’
s
used
as
a
dye
–
a
few
washes
,
and
it
’
s
gone
(
Q25
)
but
the
wool
ended
up
just
a
sort
of
watery
cream
shade
(
Q26
)
it
was
so
rare
.
I
didn
’
t
use
it
.
It
fell
out
of
use
centuries
ago
(
Q27
)
It
can
be
extremely
dangerous

it

The

agreed
that

made
them
feel
more

Our
staff
were
able
to

them

such
as
writing
down

and
speaking
with
confidence

potential
customers

which
they
had
found
quite
difficult

we

also

I
don
’

understand
how
they
can
get
away
with
calling
them
chicken
flavour
when
they
only
contain
artificial
additives
I
’

at

have
expected
them
to
contain
a
small

chicken

’
t
(
Q27

And
what
I
couldn
’
t
get
over
is
the
fact
that
it
was
brought
in
without
enough
consultation

it
